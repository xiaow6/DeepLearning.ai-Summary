### Deep Learning
Refers to training Neural networks.

### What is a (Neural Network) NN?

- Single neuron == linear regression, house size to house price. 
- Simple NN graph:
  - ![](Images/Others/01.jpg)
  - Image taken from [tutorialspoint.com](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/)
- RELU stands for rectified linear unit is the most popular activation function right now that makes deep NNs train faster now. And rectify just means taking a max of 0.
- Hidden layers predicts connection between inputs automatically, thats what deep learning is good at.
- Deep NN consists of more hidden layers (Deeper layers)
  - ![](Images/Others/02.png)
  - Image taken from [opennn.net](http://www.opennn.net/)
- Each Input will be connected to the hidden layer and the NN will decide the connections.
- Supervised learning means we have the input and output (X,Y) and we need to get the function that maps X to Y.

### Supervised learning with neural networks

- So far, almost all the economic value created by neural networks has been through one type of machine learning, called supervised learning.
- Different types of neural networks for supervised learning which includes:
  - CNN or convolutional neural networks (Useful in computer vision)
  - RNN or Recurrent neural networks (Useful in Speech recognition or NLP)
  - Standard NN (Useful for Structured data)
  - Hybrid/custom NN or a Collection of NNs for complicated application like autonomous driving.
- Structured data is like the databases and tables.
- Unstructured data is like images, video, audio, and text.
- Structured data gives more money because companies relies on prediction on its big data.But human race is good at understanding unstructured data.
- Image of CNN, RNN, and standard NN.

- ![](Images/CNN.png)
 ![](Images/RNN.png)

### Why is deep learning taking off?

- Deep learning is taking off for 3 reasons:
  1. Data:
     - Using this image we can conclude:
       - ![](Images/11.png)
     - For small data NN can perform as Linear regression or SVM (Support vector machine)
     - For big data a small NN is better that SVM
     - For big data a big NN is better that a medium NN is better that small NN.
     - Hopefully we have a lot of data because the world is using the computer a little bit more
       -- Mobiles and cameras
       -- IOT (Internet of things)
  2. Computation:
     - GPUs.
     - Powerful CPUs.
     - Distributed computing.
     - ASICs
  3. Algorithm:
     1. Creative algorithms has appeared that changed the way NN works.
        - For example using RELU function is so much better than using SIGMOID function in training a NN because it helps with the vanishing gradient problem.
- The faster algorithm and better hardware make the entire Deep learning community grow faster as you can have an experimental result from your idea and code in a shorter time.

## Neural Networks Basics

> Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.

### Binary classification

- Mainly he is talking about how to do a logistic regression to make a binary classifier. Logistic regression is an algorithm for binary classification.
  - ![log](Images/Others/03.png)
  - Image taken from [3.bp.blogspot.com](http://3.bp.blogspot.com)
- He talked about an example of knowing if the current image contains a cat or not.
- Here are some notations:
  - `M is the number of training vectors`
  - `Nx is the size of the input vector`
  - `Ny is the size of the output vector`
  - `X(1) is the first input vector`
  - `Y(1) is the first output vector`
  - `X = [x(1) x(2).. x(M)]`
  - `Y = (y(1) y(2).. y(M))`
  - `X.shape = (Nx, M)`
  - `Y.shape = (1, M)`
- We will use python in this course.
- In NumPy we can make matrices and make operations on them in a fast and reliable time.

### Logistic regression

- Algorithm is used for classification algorithm of 2 classes.
- Y_hat is your estimation of Y, it's  the probability of the chance that Y is equal to one given the input features X.
- Equations:
  - Simple equation, linear regression:	`y = wx + b`
  - If x is a vector: `y = w(transpose)x + b`,but this is not a good algorithm, because the output is not between 0 and 1.
  - If we need y to be in between 0 and 1 (probability), logistic regression : `y = sigmoid(w(transpose)x + b)`
  - In some notations this might be used: `y = sigmoid(w(transpose)x)`
    - While `b` is `w0` of `w` and we add `x0 = 1`. but we won't use this notation in the course (Andrew said that the first notation is better).

- Image of Sigmoid function.
![log](Images/sigmoid.png)
- Definition of sigmoid function. 
![log](Images/sigmoid2.png)
- In binary classification `Y` has to be between `0` and `1`.
- In the last equation `w` is a vector of `Nx` and `b` is a real number

### Logistic regression cost function

- Cost function is used to train the parameter W and B.
- First loss function would be the square root error:  `L(y',y) = 1/2 (y' - y)^2`
  - But we won't use this notation because it leads us to optimization problem which is non convex, means it contains  multiple local optimum points.
- This is the loss function that we will use: `L(y',y) = - (y*log(y') + (1-y)*log(1-y'))`
- To explain the last function lets see:
  - if `y = 1` ==> `L(y',1) = -log(y')`  ==> we want the loss function is smallest ==> we want `y'` to be the largest   ==> `y`' biggest value is 1
  - if `y = 0` ==> `L(y',0) = -log(1-y')` ==> we want the loss function is smallest ==> we want `1-y'` to be the largest ==> `y'` can only be as close to 0 as possible.
- Then the Cost function will be: `J(w,b) = (1/m) * Sum(L(y'[i],y[i]))` = `- (1/m) * Sum(y(i)*log(y'(i)) + (1-y(i))*log(1-y'(i)))`
- The loss function computes the error for a single training example; the cost function is the average of the loss functions of the entire training set.
- Watch the [optional course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/SmIbQ/explanation-of-logistic-regression-cost-function-optional) to figure out why we choose this loss function and cost function. 
- The quiz: we generally say that the output of a neuron is a = g(Wx + b) where g is the activation function (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, ...).

### Gradient Descent

- We want to predict `w` and `b` that minimize the cost function.
- Our cost function is convex.
- First we initialize `w` and `b` to 0,0 or initialize them to a random value in the convex function and then try to improve the values the reach minimum value.
- In Logistic regression people always use 0,0 instead of random.
- The gradient decent algorithm repeats: `w = w - alpha * dw`
  where alpha is the learning rate and `dw` is the derivative of `w` (Change to `w`)
  The derivative is also the slope of `w`
- Looks like greedy algorithms. the derivative give us the direction to improve our parameters.


- The actual equations we will implement:
  - `w = w - alpha * d(J(w,b) / dw)`        (how much the function slopes in the w direction)
  - `b = b - alpha * d(J(w,b) / db)`        (how much the function slopes in the d direction)

### Derivatives

- We will talk about some of required calculus.
- You don't need to be a calculus geek to master deep learning but you'll need some skills from it.
- Derivative of a linear line is its slope.
  - ex. `f(a) = 3a`                    `d(f(a))/d(a) = 3`
  - if `a = 2` then `f(a) = 6`
  - if we move a a little bit `a = 2.001` then `f(a) = 6.003` means that we multiplied the derivative (Slope) to the moved area and added it to the last result.

### More Derivatives examples

- `f(a) = a^2`  ==> `d(f(a))/d(a) = 2a`
  - `a = 2`  ==> `f(a) = 4`
  - `a = 2.0001` ==> `f(a) = 4.0004` approx.
- `f(a) = a^3`  ==> `d(f(a))/d(a) = 3a^2`
- `f(a) = log(a)`  ==> `d(f(a))/d(a) = 1/a`
- To conclude, Derivative is the slope and slope is different in different points in the function thats why the derivative is a function.

### Computation graph

- It's a graph that organizes the computation from left to right.
  - ![](Images/02.png)

### Derivatives with a Computation Graph

- Calculus chain rule says:
  If `x -> y -> z`          (x effect y and y effects z)
  Then `d(z)/d(x) = d(z)/d(y) * d(y)/d(x)`
- The video illustrates a big example.
  - ![](Images/03.png)
- We compute the derivatives on a graph from right to left and it will be a lot more easier.
- `dvar` means the derivatives of a final output variable with respect to various intermediate quantities.

### Logistic Regression Gradient Descent

- In the video he discussed the derivatives of gradient decent example for one sample with two features `x1` and `x2`.
  - ![](Images/04.png)
- The final step in that computation is to go back to compute how much you need to change W and B, 
- `W = W - alpha * dW`
- `B = B - alpha * dB`
- To compute dZï¼Œthe key point is to compute the derivative of Sigmoid function.  `If g(x) = 1 / f(x), g'(x) = - f'(x) / (square(f(x))) `, the derivative of sigmoid function is `a * (1 - a)`
- `dW = X*dz`
- `dB = dz`
- Check the vectorized implementation for dw,db.

### Gradient Descent on m Examples

- Lets say we have these variables:

  ```
  	X1					Feature
  	X2                  Feature
  	W1                  Weight of the first feature.
  	W2                  Weight of the second feature.
  	B                   Logistic Regression parameter.
  	M                   Number of training examples
  	Y(i)				Expected output of i
  ```

- So we have:
  ![](Images/09.png)

- Then from right to left we will calculate derivations compared to the result:

  ```
  	d(a)  = d(l)/d(a) = -(y/a) + ((1-y)/(1-a))
  	d(z)  = d(l)/d(z) = a - y
  	d(W1) = X1 * d(z)
  	d(W2) = X2 * d(z)
  	d(B) = d(z)
  ```

- From the above we can conclude the logistic regression pseudo code:

  ```
  	J = 0; dw1 = 0; dw2 =0; db = 0;                 # Devs.
  	w1 = 0; w2 = 0; b=0;							# Weights
  	for i = 1 to m
  		# Forward pass
  		z(i) = W1*x1(i) + W2*x2(i) + b
  		a(i) = Sigmoid(z(i))
  		J += (Y(i)*log(a(i)) + (1-Y(i))*log(1-a(i)))

  		# Backward pass
  		dz(i) = a(i) - Y(i)
  		dw1 += dz(i) * x1(i)
  		dw2 += dz(i) * x2(i)
  		db  += dz(i)
  	J /= m
  	dw1/= m
  	dw2/= m
  	db/= m

  	# Gradient descent
  	w1 = w1 - alpa * dw1
  	w2 = w2 - alpa * dw2
  	b = b - alpa * db
  ```

- The above code should run for some iterations to minimize error.

- So there will be two inner loops to implement the logistic regression.

- Vectorization is so important on deep learning to reduce loops. In the last code we can make the whole loop in one step using vectorization!

### Vectorization

- Deep learning shines when the dataset are big. However for loops will make you wait a lot for a result. Thats why we need vectorization to get rid of some of our for loops.
- NumPy library (dot) function is using vectorization by default.
- The vectorization can be done on CPU or GPU thought the SIMDï¼ˆsingle instruction multiple dataï¼‰ operation. But itâ€˜s faster on GPU.
- Whenever possible avoid for loops.
- Most of the NumPy library methods are vectorized version.
- Introduced some functions in Numpy.

### Vectorizing Logistic Regression

- We will implement Logistic Regression using one for loop then without any for loop.
- As an input we have a matrix `X` and it's `[Nx, m]` and a matrix `Y` and it's `[Ny, m]`.
- We will then compute at instance `[z1,z2...zm] = W' * X + [b,b,...b]`. This can be written in python as:

    		Z = np.dot(W.T,X) + b    # Vectorization, then broadcasting b, Z shape is (1, m)
    		A = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-Z))   # Vectorization, A shape is (1, m)
this is the vectorized implementation of forward prop.
- Vectorizing Logistic Regression's Gradient Output:

   			dz = A - Y                  # Vectorization, dz shape is (1, m)
   			dw = np.dot(X, dz.T) / m    # Vectorization, dw shape is (Nx, 1)
   			db = np.sum(dz) / m           # Vectorization, dz shape is (1, 1)
- update w and b with:

           w := w - alpha * dw
           b := b - alpha * db
- But this is just one iteration, you still need one for loop for certain iteration times to finish Implementing Logistic Regression. 

### Notes on Python and NumPy

- In NumPy, `obj.sum(axis = 0)` sums the columns while `obj.sum(axis = 1)` sums the rows.
- In NumPy, `obj.reshape(1,4)` changes the shape of the matrix by broadcasting the values.
- Reshape is cheap in calculations so put it everywhere you're not sure about the calculations.
- Broadcasting works when you do a matrix operation with matrices that doesn't match for the operation, in this case NumPy automatically makes the shapes ready for the operation by broadcasting the values.
- In general principle of broadcasting. If you have an (m,n) matrix and you add(+) or subtract(-) or multiply(*) or divide(/) with a (1,n) matrix, then this will copy it m times into an (m,n) matrix. The same with if you use those operations with a (m , 1) matrix, then this will copy it n times into (m, n) matrix. And then apply the addition, subtraction, and multiplication of division element wise.
- Some tricks to eliminate all the strange bugs in the code:
  - If you didn't specify the shape of a vector, it will take a shape of `(m,)` and the transpose operation won't work. You have to reshape it to `(m, 1)`
  - Try to not use the rank one matrix in ANN
  - Rank one matrix doesn't behave consistently as either a row vector nor a column vector, which makes some of its effects nonintuitive.
  - Don't hesitate to use `assert(a.shape == (5,1))` to check if your matrix shape is the required one.
  - If you've found a rank one matrix try to run reshape on it.
- Jupyter / IPython notebooks are so useful library in python that makes it easy to integrate code and document at the same time. It runs in the browser and doesn't need an IDE to run.
  - To open Jupyter Notebook, open the command line and call: `jupyter-notebook` It should be installed to work.
- To Compute the derivative of Sigmoid:

  ```
  	s = sigmoid(x)
  	ds = s * (1 - s)       # derivative  using calculus
  ```

- To make an image of `(width,height,depth)` be a vector, use this:

  ```
  v = image.reshape(image.shape[0]*image.shape[1]*image.shape[2],1)  #reshapes the image.
  ```
  Introduced np.shape and np.reshape() in the programming exercise. 

- Gradient descent converges faster after normalization of the input matrices.In the exercise we use 
  ```
  np.linalg.norm(x, axis = 1, keepdims = True)
  ```
- axis = 1 means sum all elements in row
```
  np.sum(x_exp, axis = 1, keepdims = True)
  ```
- A trick when you want to flatten a matrix X of shape (a, b, c, d) to a matrix X_flatten of shape (b * c * d, a) is to use:
  ```
  X_flatten = X.reshape(X.shape[0], -1).T
  ```
- One common preprocessing step in machine learning is to center and standardize your dataset, meaning that you substract the mean of the whole numpy array from each example, and then divide each example by the standard deviation of the whole numpy array. But for picture datasets, it is simpler and more convenient and works almost as well to just divide every row of the dataset by 255 (the maximum value of a pixel channel).
- Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:
   - Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
   - Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
   - "Standardize" the data
  
### General Notes

- np.dot(a,b) is matrix product, a shape is (m, n), b shape is (n, p), result shape is (m, p)
- a * b is element wise product. a , b and result have the same shape. 
- The main steps for building a Neural Network are:
  - Define the model structure (such as number of input features and outputs)
  - Initialize the model's parameters.
  - Loop.
    - Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
    - Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
    - Update parameters (gradient descent)
- Preprocessing the dataset is important.
- Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm.
- Different learning rates give different costs and thus different predictions results.
- If the learning rate is too large (0.01), the cost may oscillate up and down. It may even diverge (though in this example, using 0.01 still eventually ends up at a good value for the cost). 
- A lower cost doesn't mean a better model. You have to check if there is possibly overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.
- In deep learning, we usually recommend that you: 
    - Choose the learning rate that better minimizes the cost function.
    - If your model overfits, use other techniques to reduce overfitting. (We'll talk about this in later videos.) 
- [kaggle.com](kaggle.com) is a good place for datasets and competitions.
- [Pieter Abbeel](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/abbeel.html) is one of the best in deep reinforcement learning.


## Shallow neural networks

> Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

### Neural Networks Overview

- In logistic regression we had:

  ```
  X1  \  
  X2   ==>  z = XW + B ==> a = Sigmoid(z) ==> l(a,Y)
  X3  /
  ```

- In neural networks with one layer we will have:

  ```
  X1  \  
  X2   =>  z1 = XW1 + B1 => a1 = Sigmoid(z1) => z2 = a1W2 + B2 => a2 = Sigmoid(z2) => l(a2,Y)
  X3  /
  ```


- `X` is the input vector `(X1, X2, X3)`, and `Y` is the output variable `(1x1)`
- A simple NN is stack of logistic regression objects.
- [1] first layer
- [2] second layer

### Neural Network Representation

- We will define the neural networks that has one hidden layer.
- NN contains of input layers, hidden layers, output layers.
- Hidden layer means we cant see that layers in the training set.
- `a0 = x` (the input layer) "a" represents the activation function.
- `a1` will represent the activation of the hidden neurons.
- `a2` will represent the output layer.
- We are talking about 2 layers NN. The input layer isn't counted.

### Computing a Neural Network's Output

- Equations of Hidden layers:
  - ![](Images/05.png)
- Here are some informations about the last image:
  - `noOfHiddenNeurons = 4`
  - `Nx = 3`
  - Shapes of the variables:
    - `W1` is the matrix of the first hidden layer, it has a shape of `(noOfHiddenNeurons,nx)`
    - `b1` is the matrix of the first hidden layer, it has a shape of `(noOfHiddenNeurons,1)`
    - `z1` is the result of the equation `z1 = W1*X + b`, it has a shape of `(noOfHiddenNeurons,1)`
    - `a1` is the result of the equation `a1 = sigmoid(z1)`, it has a shape of `(noOfHiddenNeurons,1)`
    - `W2` is the matrix of the second hidden layer, it has a shape of `(1,noOfHiddenNeurons)`
    - `b2` is the matrix of the second hidden layer, it has a shape of `(1,1)`
    - `z2` is the result of the equation `z2 = W2*a1 + b`, it has a shape of `(1,1)`
    - `a2` is the result of the equation `a2 = sigmoid(z2)`, it has a shape of `(1,1)`
- What the notation in NN means:
  ![](Images/notations.png)

### Vectorizing across multiple examples
- Check the slides for what round bracket and square bracket mean.
- Pseudo code for forward propagation for the 2 layers NN:

  ```
  for i = 1 to m
    z[1, i] = W1*x[i] + b1      # shape of z[1, i] is (noOfHiddenNeurons,1)
    a[1, i] = sigmoid(z[1, i])  # shape of a[1, i] is (noOfHiddenNeurons,1)
    z[2, i] = W2*a[1, i] + b2   # shape of z[2, i] is (1,1)
    a[2, i] = sigmoid(z[2, i])  # shape of a[2, i] is (1,1)
  ```

- Lets say we have `X` on shape `(Nx,m)`. So the new pseudo code:

  ```
  Z1 = W1X + b1     # shape of Z1 (noOfHiddenNeurons,m)
  A1 = sigmoid(Z1)  # shape of A1 (noOfHiddenNeurons,m)
  Z2 = W2A1 + b2    # shape of Z2 is (1,m)
  A2 = sigmoid(Z2)  # shape of A2 is (1,m)
  ```

- If you notice always m is the number of columns.
- In the last example we can call `X` = `A0`. So the previous step can be rewritten as:

  ```
  Z1 = W1A0 + b1    # shape of Z1 (noOfHiddenNeurons,m)
  A1 = sigmoid(Z1)  # shape of A1 (noOfHiddenNeurons,m)
  Z2 = W2A1 + b2    # shape of Z2 is (1,m)
  A2 = sigmoid(Z2)  # shape of A2 is (1,m)
  ```

### Activation functions

- So far we are using sigmoid, but in some cases other functions can be a lot better.
- Sigmoid can lead us to gradient decent problem where the updates are so low.
- Sigmoid activation function range is [0,1]
  `A = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z)) # Where z is the input matrix`
- Tanh activation function range is [-1,1]   (Shifted version of sigmoid function)
  - In NumPy we can implement Tanh using one of these methods:
    `A = (np.exp(z) - np.exp(-z)) / (np.exp(z) + np.exp(-z)) # Where z is the input matrix`

    Or
    `A = np.tanh(z)   # Where z is the input matrix`
- It turns out that the tanh activation usually works better than sigmoid activation function for hidden units because the mean of its output is closer to zero rather than 0.5, and so it centers the data better for the next layer. Sigmoid function is better for output layer because for binary classification, the result is 0 or 1.
- Sigmoid or Tanh function disadvantage is that if the input is too small or too high, the slope will be near zero which will cause us the gradient decent problem.
- One of the popular activation functions that solved the slow gradient decent is the RELU(rectified linear unit) function.
  `RELU = max(0,z) # so if z is negative the slope is 0 and if z is positive the slope remains linear.`
- So here is some basic rule for choosing activation functions, if your classification is between 0 and 1, use the output activation as sigmoid(or not, never use it for other layers because tanh is superior) and the others as RELU.
- Leaky RELU activation function different of RELU is that if the input is negative the slope will be so small. It works as RELU but most people uses RELU.
  `Leaky_RELU = max(0.01z,z)  #the 0.01 can be a parameter for your algorithm.`
- In NN you will decide a lot of choices like:
  - No of hidden layers.
  - No of neurons in each hidden layer.
  - Learning rate.       (The most important parameter)
  - Activation functions.
  - And others..
- It turns out there are no guide lines for that. You should try all choices for example.

### Why do you need non-linear activation functions?

- If we removed the activation function from our algorithm that can be called linearï¼ˆidentityï¼‰ activation function.
- Linear activation function will output linear activations
  - Whatever hidden layers you add, the activation will be always linear like logistic regression (So its useless in a lot of complex problems)
  - n linear activation function equal to one linear activation function.
- You might use linear activation function in one place - in the output layer if the output is real numbers (regression problem). But even in this case if the output value is non-negative you could use RELU instead.

### Derivatives of activation functions

- Derivation of Sigmoid activation function:

  ```
  g(z) = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))
  g'(z) = (1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))) * (1 - (1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))))
  g'(z) = g(z) * (1 - g(z))
  ```

- Derivation of Tanh activation function:

  ```
  g(z)  = (e^z - e^-z) / (e^z + e^-z)
  g'(z) = 1 - np.tanh(z)^2 = 1 - g(z)^2
  ```

- Derivation of RELU activation function:

  ```
  g(z)  = np.maximum(0,z)
  g'(z) = { 0  if z < 0
            1  if z >= 0  }
  ```

- Derivation of leaky RELU activation function:

  ```
  g(z)  = np.maximum(0.01 * z, z)
  g'(z) = { 0.01  if z < 0
            1     if z >= 0   }
  ```

### Gradient descent for Neural Networks
- In this section we will have the full back propagation of the neural network (Just the equations with no explanations).
- Gradient descent algorithm:
  - NN parameters:
    - `n[0] = Nx`
    - `n[1] = NoOfHiddenNeurons`
    - `n[2] = NoOfOutputNeurons = 1`
    - `W1` shape is `(n[1],n[0])`
    - `b1` shape is `(n[1],1)`
    - `W2` shape is `(n[2],n[1])`
    - `b2` shape is `(n[2],1)`
  - Cost function `I =  I(W1, b1, W2, b2) = (1/m) * Sum(L(Y,A2))`
  - Then Gradient descent:

    ```
    Repeat:
    		Compute predictions (y'[i], i = 0,...m)
    		Get derivatives: dW1, db1, dW2, db2
    		Update: W1 = W1 - LearningRate * dW1
    				b1 = b1 - LearningRate * db1
    				W2 = W2 - LearningRate * dW2
    				b2 = b2 - LearningRate * db2
    ```

- Forward propagation:

  ```
  Z1 = W1A0 + b1    # A0 is X
  A1 = g1(Z1)
  Z2 = W2A1 + b2
  A2 = Sigmoid(Z2)      # Sigmoid because the output is between 0 and 1
  ```

- Backpropagation (derivations):   
  ```
  dZ2 = A2 - Y      # derivative of cost function we used * derivative of the sigmoid function
  dW2 = (dZ2 * A1.T) / m
  db2 = Sum(dZ2) / m
  dZ1 = (W2.T * dZ2) * g'1(Z1)  # element wise product (*)
  dW1 = (dZ1 * A0.T) / m   # A0 = X
  db1 = Sum(dZ1) / m
  # Hint there are transposes with multiplication because to keep dimensions correct
  # The np.sum is a Python NumPy command for summing across one-dimension of a matrix. In this case axis = 1, summing horizontally, and what keepdims = True does is, it prevents Python from outputting one of those funny rank one arrays
  ```
- How we derived the 6 equations of the backpropagation:

### Random Initialization

- In logistic regression it wasn't important to initialize the weights randomly, while in NN we have to initialize them randomly.

- If we initialize all the weights with zeros in NN it won't work (initializing bias with zero is OK):
  - all hidden units will be completely identical (symmetric) - compute exactly the same function
  - on each gradient descent iteration all the hidden units will always update the same

- To solve this we initialize the W's with a small random numbers:

  ```
  W1 = np.random.randn((2,2)) * 0.01    # 0.01 to make it small enough
  b1 = np.zeros((2,1))                  # its ok to have b as zero, it won't get us to the symmetry breaking problem
  ```

- We need small values because in sigmoid (or tanh), for example, if the weight is too large you are more likely to end up even at the very start of training with very large values of Z. Which causes your tanh or your sigmoid activation function to be saturated, thus slowing down learning. If you don't have any sigmoid or tanh activation functions throughout your neural network, this is less of an issue.

- Constant 0.01 is alright for 1 hidden layer networks, but if the NN is deep this number can be changed but it will always be a small number.

### Programming Note



## Deep Neural Networks

> Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.

### Deep L-layer neural network

- Shallow NN versus depth NN is a matter of degree.
- on the machine learning community, has realized that there are functions that very deep neural networks can learn that shallower models are often unable to. 
- Although for any given problem, it might be hard to predict in advance exactly how deep in your network you would want. So it would be reasonable to try logistic regression, and treat the depth as a hyperparameter.
- We will use the notation `L` to denote the number of layers in a NN.
- `n[l]` is the number of neurons in a specific layer `l`.
- `n[0]` denotes the number of neurons input layer. `n[L]` denotes the number of neurons in output layer.
- `g[l]` is the layer l activation function.
- `a[l] = g[l](z[l])`
- `w[l]` weights is used for `z[l]`
- `x = a[0]`, `a[l] = y_hat`
- These were the notation we will use for deep neural network.
- So we have:
  - A vector `n` of shape `(1, NoOfLayers+1)`
  - A vector `g` of shape `(1, NoOfLayers)`
  - A list of different shapes `w` based on the number of neurons on the previous and the current layer.
  - A list of different shapes `b` based on the number of neurons on the current layer.

### Forward Propagation in a Deep Network

- Forward propagation general rule for one input:

  ```
  z[l] = W[l]a[l-1] + b[l]
  a[l] = g[l](a[l])
  ```

- Forward propagation general rule for `m` inputs:

  ```
  Z[l] = W[l]A[l-1] + B[l]
  A[l] = g[l](A[l])
  ```

- We can't compute the whole layers forward propagation without a for loop so its OK to have a for loop here.
- The dimensions of the matrices are so important you need to figure it out so that you can write bug free code.

### Getting your matrix dimensions right

- The best way to debug your matrices dimensions is by a pencil and paper.
- Dimension of `W[l]` is `(n[l],n[l-1])` . Can be thought by right to left.
- Dimension of `b[l]` is `(n[l],1)`. Can be thought by row same as W1, but only one column.
- `dw` has the same shape as `W`, while `db` is the same shape as `b`
- For a single neuron, dimension of `z[l]`, `a[l]` , `dz[l]`, and `da[l]` is `(n[l], 1)`.
- In vectorized implementation, dimension of `Z[l]`, `A[l]`, `dZ[l]`, and `dA[l]`  is `(n[l],m)`.

### Why deep representations?

- Why deep NN works well, we will discuss this question in this section by introducing face recognizion.
- Deep NN makes relations with data from simpler to complex. In each layer it tries to make a relation with the previous layer. E.g.:
  - 1) Face recognition application:
      - Image ==> Edges ==> Face parts ==> Faces ==> desired face
  - 2) Audio recognition application:
      - Audio ==> Low level sound features like (sss,bb) ==> Phonemes ==> Words ==> Sentences
- Neural Researchers think that deep neural networks "think" like brains (simple ==> complex)
- Another intuition why deep NN works better is Circuit theory and deep learning: the difference is O(logn) and O($2^n$)
  - ![](Images/07.png)
- When starting on an application don't start directly by dozens of hidden layers. Try the simplest solutions (e.g. Logistic Regression), then try the shallow neural network and so on.

### Building blocks of deep neural networks

- Forward and back propagation for a layer l:
  - ![Untitled](Images/10.png)
- Deep NN blocks:
  - ![](Images/08.png)

### Forward and Backward Propagation

- Pseudo code for forward propagation for layer l:

  ```
  Input  A[l-1]
  Z[l] = W[l]A[l-1] + b[l]
  A[l] = g[l](Z[l])
  Output A[l], cache(Z[l])
  ```

- Pseudo  code for back propagation for layer l:

  ```
  Input da[l], Caches
  dZ[l] = dA[l] * g'[l](Z[l])
  dW[l] = (dZ[l]A[l-1].T) / m
  db[l] = sum(dZ[l])/m                # Dont forget axis=1, keepdims=True
  dA[l-1] = w[l].T * dZ[l]            # The multiplication here are a dot product.
  Output dA[l-1], dW[l], db[l]
  ```

- If we have used our loss function then:

  ```
  dA[L] = (-(y/a) + ((1-y)/(1-a)))
  ```
- In Andrew's opinion, sometimes deep learning codes works magically, even you don't have so many lines of codes. That's because the data set is huge and good. 

 
### Parameters vs Hyperparameters

- Main parameters of the NN is `W` and `b`
- Hyper parameters (parameters that control the algorithm) are like:
  - Learning rate.
  - Number of iteration.
  - Number of hidden layers `L`.
  - Number of hidden units `n`.
  - Choice of activation functions, but a[l] is not.
- You have to try values yourself of hyper parameters because you don't know in advance which hyperparameter works better.
- In the earlier days of DL and ML learning rate was often called a parameter, but it really is (and now everybody call it) a hyperparameter.
- For computer vision, NLP, ad recommendation or other applications, you can't just use one set of hyperparameters for all applications, you have to try a range of hyperparameters. This is a disappointing aspect of deep learning. And over months, you should try to find better hyperparameters for your algorithm because the dataset, CPU, GPU may change, your best hyperparameter at that time may not still be the best choice.
- On the next course we will see how to optimize hyperparameters.

### What does this have to do with the brain

- The analogy that "It is like the brain" has become really an oversimplified explanation.
- There is a very simplistic analogy between a single logistic unit and a single neuron in the brain.
- No human today understand how a human brain neuron works.
- No human today know exactly how many neurons on the brain.
- Deep learning in Andrew's opinion is very good at learning very flexible, complex functions to learn X to Y mappings, to learn input-output mappings (supervised learning).
- The field of computer vision has taken a bit more inspiration from the human brains then other disciplines that also apply deep learning.
- NN is a small representation of how brain work. The most near model of human brain is in the computer vision (CNN)
